# Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition with OpenCV

This repository contains an simple implementation of computer vision techniques to track hand motions and recognize hand gestures using OpenCV.

## Introduction
The project aims to provide a comprehensive demonstration of hand tracking and gesture recognition using computer vision. It utilizes the OpenCV library and the `HandTrackingModule` from the `cvzone` library for hand tracking.

## Implementation
The project has been extended to include hand gesture recognition functionality. The Python script has been updated to detect various hand gestures such as thumbs up, peace sign, and OK sign.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- OpenCV
- cvzone

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eshansurendra/handTrackWithOpenCV.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install cvzone
    ```
3. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python hand_tracking.py
    ```

## Gesture Recognition
The project currently recognizes the following gestures:
- Thumbs up
- Peace sign
- OK sign

You can extend the gesture recognition functionality by adding more checks in the Python script.
